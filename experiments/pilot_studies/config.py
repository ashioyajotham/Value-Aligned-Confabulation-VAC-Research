Welcome to the Value Elicitation Study.

We’ll show you short scenarios and two possible AI responses. For each pair, please:
- Choose which response you prefer (or say no preference)
- Rate how acceptable each response is (1–5)
- Share brief reasoning

You can remain anonymous. If you prefer not to share a name, we’ll generate a random ID.
